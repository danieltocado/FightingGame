_Fighting game made with JavaScript_

**This project is still WIP**

## Functionality

- Pick three fighters for each team.

- Press the hit button to attack!

- You can only heal your fighter once per round by dropping the potion below him.

## Known bugs

- Seems like player 1 can't ever win :(

- When picking the team2 fighters they don't disappear from the panel.

- Some stats from the fighters are quite unbalanced at this moment.

## Fixed bugs

- Both potions works correctly now.
