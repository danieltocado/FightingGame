# JS Fighting Game (PreAlpha)

_Fighting game made with JavaScript_

**This project is still WIP**

## Functionality

- Pick three fighters for each team.

- Just press the hit button to attack!

- You can heal one time per round your fighter by droping the potion below.

## Known bugs

- Seems like player 2 cant ever win :(

- If player 1 heals himself first, both potions will disappear. Not happening if player 2 heals first.

- When picking the team2 fighters, they won't disappear from the panel.

- Some stats from the fighters are quite disbalanced at this moment.
